The project is an initial introduction to the Spring Statemachine project.

An overview of all the projects involved can be found [here](https://github.com/mariamihai/udemy-sbm-overview).

## Status
**[COMPLETED]** - As I finished the section of the course and the associated project, I am setting a personal status of "Completed" and will probably not update this repository in the near future as this was a learning project.
